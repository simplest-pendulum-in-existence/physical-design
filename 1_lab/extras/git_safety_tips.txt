Git Safety Net Tips
===================

1. Commit Frequently
   - Even if your changes are incomplete, make small commits.
   - Use messages like "WIP: checkpoint" for partial progress.

2. Use Git Stash
   - Run `git stash` to save uncommitted changes safely.
   - Retrieve later with `git stash pop`.

3. Avoid `git restore .` Without Backup
   - This will reset files to last commit and discard local changes.
   - Always stash or commit before running it.

4. Enable a Quick "WIP" Alias
   - Add this to your ~/.gitconfig:
     [alias]
       wip = !git add -A && git commit -m 'WIP checkpoint'
   - Run `git wip` anytime to save a snapshot.

5. Check Editor Backups
   - Vim: look for `.filename.swp` or `filename~` files.
   - VSCode: check `.vscode` or local history extensions.

6. System Recovery (Last Resort)
   - Tools like `extundelete` may recover files on ext4.
   - Harder if using LVM/XFS (often unrecoverable once deleted).
